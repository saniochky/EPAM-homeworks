"""
File `data/students.csv` stores information about students in CSV format.
This file contains the studentâ€™s names, age and average mark.

1. Implement a function get_top_performers which receives file path and
returns names of top performer students.
Example:
def get_top_performers(file_path, number_of_top_students=5):
    pass

print(get_top_performers("students.csv"))

Result:
['Teresa Jones', 'Richard Snider', 'Jessica Dubose', 'Heather Garcia',
'Joseph Head']

2. Implement a function write_students_age_desc which receives the file path
with students info and writes CSV student information to the new file in
descending order of age.
Example:
def write_students_age_desc(file_path, output_file):
    pass

Content of the resulting file:
student name,age,average mark
